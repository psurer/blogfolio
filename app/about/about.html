			<h2>Priscilla</h2>
			<p>Hi, I'm Priscilla, a web developer and tech enthusiast. Thanks for stopping by my site, 
                I created this as a way to share my projects, and combine my passions for tech and travel. 
                 I've been honing my skills through various personal projects and courses, 
                 and I'm excited to share them with you through this portfolio.
                  My goal is to create effective and user-friendly solutions to various problems, 
                  and I'm always looking to learn and grow in my field. Feel free to browse my projects and blog,
                   and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to work together.
                </p>
